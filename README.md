# Smithsonian Fork of elstudio/actions-js-build

This fork has been modified to accommodate GitHub Actions needed for building
sites that use forumone/gesso.

This repository contains three actions:

- **merge** (smithsonian/actions-js-build/merge@master): Merges the branch that triggered this action onto the branch specified in the 'Checkout deploy branch` step.
- **build** (smithsonian/actions-js-build/build@master): Installs npm dependencies and then runs `gulp build`.
- **commit** (smithsonian/actions-js-build/commit@master): Commits any file changes, and pushes them to the working branch specified in the 'Checkout working branch' step.

## Example usage

```yaml
name: Build and commit Gesso theme files to deploy branch

  push:
    branches: [ master ]
